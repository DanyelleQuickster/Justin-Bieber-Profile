                He's a Canadian singer. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol. Bieber's versatile cross-genre approach towards music and showmanship have received widespread recognition. He achieved commercial success with his debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years. The album also contained the internationally successful single "Baby", which became one of the highest certified singles of all time in the US. His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Subsequently, his third studio album, Believe (2012), saw Bieber experiment with dance-pop and mature themes. Following Believe, Bieber was involved in various controversies and legal issues between 2013 and 2014, which drastically impacted his public image. However, since 2015, he has been setting his priorities to focus on mental health and take responsibility for past transgressions. Bieber's fourth studio album, Purpose, was released in 2015. It was preceded by "Where Are Ü Now", a collaboration with Jack Ü, which saw Bieber explore EDM, and win the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. Purpose embodied a multi-genre production and produced three number-one singles: "What Do You Mean?", "Love Yourself", and "Sorry". Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017 including DJ Khaled's "I'm the One", which became his first number-one single in hip hop. A week later, he released his remix to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's "Despacito", claiming his fifth number-one single and first in Latin.
